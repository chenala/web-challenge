This was built using React, Redux, including Fetch to make the GraphQL API calls to Github API.

To run this yourself, you are required to have your own token for Github API. Once you have your token, go to `./api_token.js` and replace the existing value of `API_TOKEN` with your key.

Enjoy!

How to run:
1. Clone this repository
2. Run the command `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Get your token and place it in `API_TOKEN` under `./api_token.js`.
3. Run the command `npm run start`
4. The react application should be running on localhost:3000
